# Coronavirus Donations

## Overview:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City has emerged as the world's epicenter. As many in the city rely on a vocation that is in-person, they now find themselves out of work. There have been shortages for many household supplies, such as groceries and toilet paper. This has had devastating effects on the population as many struggle to acquire basic needed items. On the flip side, many have also begun to hoard essential items that may go bad without ever being used. 

Coronavirus Donations is an app that allows users to connect with those who are donating or in need. Users will be categorized by the borough that they reside in, and will be able to contact each other to arrange for a no-contact pickup. 

## Data Model

This application will store Users and their donations if they choose to donate.

An Example User: 

{
	firstName: "Jahnavi",
	lastName: "Vyas",
	email: "jv1340@nyu.edu",
	password: #####,
	borough: "Manhattan",
	donations: ["2% milk", 5]

}

An Example Donation:

{
	item: "2% milk",
	quantity: 5
}
